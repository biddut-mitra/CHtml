# CHtml
This is like PHP, but its in C++.

CHtml takes in an HTML file with special variables and replaces those varables
with programmer's assigned values. And outputs another HTML file with values 
replaced. May be from SQL!!!

This is good for corporations/banks/govt's, where they want more secured webs,
with very small "public" code.

This is mostly used in CGI.
